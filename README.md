# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-with-Multiple-Machine-Learning-Model

Title: "MNIST Digit Recognition Project Overview"


The project aims to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using machine learning models like SVM, k-NN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset was preprocessed using Min-Max scaling. Models were trained, evaluated using various metrics, and applied to predict digits from the test set.

Dataset Description:

The MNIST dataset comprises 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), with each image labeled accordingly. It includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, commonly divided for model evaluation. MNIST serves as a benchmark for digit recognition, image classification, and machine learning algorithm experimentation.
